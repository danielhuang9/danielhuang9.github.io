    <h1>Sports</h1>
    <div class="vls">
        <h2>Soccer</h2>
        <p>I began playing soccer at a young age because my parents wanted me to be active. 
        I remember stepping on the field for the first time and just knowing that I would love
        this sport. As I played for longer, I became more invested and decided to play competitively
        Waterloo. Playing at a high level taught me to work well in a team and understand
        the importance of relationships. Everything I know about working together in a team today, I owe 
        to soccer.</p>

    <h1>Gaming</h1>
    <div class="vlg">
        <h2>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h2>
        <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the first competitive game I got in to.
        I have always been a competitive person and these habits transferred well into CSGO.
        I would spend hours weekly studying the game and practicing my mechanics. With this
        dedication, I was able to reach the highest rank in the game, Global Elite.</p>
        <h2>Valorant</h2>
        <p><a href="https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/dHaniel%230609/overview"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7nXMfqt/immtriangle.png" class="imm" 
        style="height:200px;width:200px;float:right"></a>
        After 4+ years of playing CSGO, I felt accomplished as I reached my peak at the highest
        rank. Another similar game, Valorant, came along and I was hooked right when I started. It
        was a great change of scenery as CSGO became stale to me. Valorant could not have come at 
        a better time. Most skills from CSGO are applicable to Valorant and I was able to reach the 
        second highest rank, Immortal.</p>
